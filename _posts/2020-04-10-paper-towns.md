Quentin, Q, lives across the street to Margo. He is infatuated with her since she moved into the neighborhood. They used to play together in their childhood.

One fine evening, Q and Margo were headed to Jefferson Park riding a bicycle. They were blown by a dead body attached to the tree. When Q took two steps back, at the same time she moved two steps forward. This shows Q was shit scared and Margo a brave girl.

That night Margo climbs Q's window and told him about her findings after a day-long investigation regarding the dead body. Rather focusing on her words he was innocently staring at her beautiful face.

Life goes on, school, home, blah blah blah... but his crush remained constant.

Margo was a cool kid who planned pranks on/with friends, likes to roam around. Along with friends, she once wrapped the neighborhood with toilet paper. Do you feel the intensity of how adventurous is she?

In contrast, Q was the silent, unassertive guy. He liked to play Resurrection along with his friends Ben ("Benjamin") and Radar ("Marcus").

Exactly after nine years, Margo again climbs through the same window and takes Q with her on an adventure. Q did not know that this night is gonna change him, the way he thinks about her, the way he looked at life. He was going to do a shit load of adventurous stuff. She had planned eleven pranks which they will be pulling on her friends. She wanted to take revenge from her ex-boyfriend and best-friend who cheated on her. They carried eight of her pranks. Then she asked Q if he had someone in mind with whom they can pull the next one.

These pranks were mostly breaking and entering.

In the tenth, they enter the highest building in the Town. They stare at the town from the top of the building, view is just amazing. She calls this view a paper town and says "Things look beautiful from the distance, but when we get close to it looks worst". She relates this to herself like how her friends are drifting away as they are getting to know her better.

Then they leave for the last one, to break into the SeaWorld.

The first time in the lifetime Q has spent such a bold night. He thinks that he may spend time with her from tomorrow. He builds the thoughts on what to speak with her when she arrives and many more. But she did not show up at the school. She goes missing.Â  She left the home. This is not the first time she left home without informing anyone. But she always left a clue where she was going.

Even this time she left the clues. This time she left the trail of clues for Quentin. Can he prove his love by finding her?

Will he be able to solve the clues, the treasure hunt? What if these clues take him to the dead ends? Even if he finds her, does she really left the clues for him? Can he convince her to come back?

Anyway, why did she even left?

A lot of unknowns, but I would say, written like a drama, but filled with mystery, a boy on an adventure to find his girl and to get answers to a few questions!!
